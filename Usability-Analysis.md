# 3. Usability Analysis 
The usability testing of our GUI mockup was conducted using a remote questionnaire. 
Questions were based on previously designed mockups: Homepage, Player Page, Game Page, Community Page, Account Settings and Search Bar.
Each question presents a task that needs to be completed using the mockup. Details of questions are outlined in section 2.1 Methodology. 
The questionnaire consisted of 19 questions in total. Types of questions are summarised below: <br>
* 7 'difficulty rating' type questions (See section 2.1 for details)
* 9 'correct or incorrect answer' type questions (See section 2.1 for details)
* 1 rating question on the overall user experience 
* 1 short-answer question asking participants to choose 3 adjectives to describe the overall experience 
* 1 long-answer question on areas of improvement

## 3.2 Usability Testing Result Analysis
The questionnaire received 20 responses. Results were analysed either quantitatively or qualitatively depending on the type of question.
'Difficulty rating' and 'correct/incorrect answer' questions were analysed with quantitative approach, while the rest were evaluated qualitatively. 

### 3.2.1 Quantitative Analysis
7 'difficulty rating' and 9 'correct/incorrect' questions were analysed based on the success and failure criteria outlined in section 2.1.1. For each question (16 questions in total), 20 responses were categorised as either 'success' or 'failure'. Subsequently, success and failure counts were summed and are presented as percentages below. On the whole, participants were able to complete tasks successfully 92% of the time. This high success rate indicates that our GUI mockup satisfies the three usability testing goals outlined in section 2.

#### Difficulty rating questions 
At least one 'difficulty rating' question was asked on each GUI mockup. Similar to above, 20 responses on 7 questions were identified as either success or failure. The counts were summed and are presented as percentages in the pie chart below. The successful task completion rate was 95%, suggesting that almost all participants found our GUI mockup easy to use and navigate.

The responses were further broken down into individual ratings to obtain a distribution of responses. 
As seen in the bar chart below, most participants selected rating 0, which corresponds to 'very easy'.
Majority of participants selected ratings 0, 1 and 2, with few selecting options 3, 4 and 5, indicating that most participants found tasks 'very easy' to complete with our GUI mockup.

#### Correct or Incorrect questions 
At least one 'correct/incorrect answer' question was asked on each GUI mockup. Once again, 20 responses on 9 questions were grouped as either success or failure. These counts were summed and are presented as percentages in the pie chart below. Some of these questions were aimed at determining whether core functionalities were divided into logical units that are obvious to users. On the whole, 90% of participants were able to complete tasks successfully.

Since the success rate was lower here when compared to 'difficulty rating' questions, success and failure counts were broken down into individual questions. On the whole, success counts were much greater than failure counts in all 9 questions. However, the last two questions, Q14 and Q15, appear to have higher failure rate than other questions. Q14 and Q15 were questions aimed to test whether core functionalities were divided into logical units that are obvious to users. For example, Q14 was 'From Account Settings, if you wanted to see your collection of games, where would you click?'. Lower success rates on these questions suggest that the division of functionalities into units is not logical and obvious to some users. Perhaps, having separate options on navigation bar instead of organising into subunits using dropdown options is a better approach.
