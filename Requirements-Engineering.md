# 1. Requirements
This section presents both functional and non-functional requirements of the game collection management and sourcing system. It includes methods of requirements capture used and other alternatives we considered. The functional and non-functional requirements were prioritised used MOSCOW method. The overall aim of the project is to create an online space for players to manage, explore, and find communities for all types of games.

## 1.2 Non-functional Requirements 
* M: Functionalities organised into visual and logical compartments for easy navigation and aesthetic layout.
* S: Fast search speed.

## 1.3 Prioritisation 
Requirements were grouped into four categories: Must(M), Should(S), Could(C) and Would(W). Requirements were categorised as 'Must' if the functionality is core to the game collection management and sourcing. Requirements that have high risk (i.e. we are unfamiliar with methods to achieve the functionality) were also placed into 'Must'. 

## 1.4 Capture Methodology 
* Document describing the requirements 
* Questionnaires were sent to gamers  
* Asking Allistair questions for clarification
* Due to COVID face-to-face interviews were not carried out
